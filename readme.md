## Search And Save

I designed and built this as a means to save locations on my weather app. I plan to learn to build web components and this is ultimatley 
what I intend to do with it. As it is now, it works rather well but the application is cumbersome.  I feel like this could be a useful component
and as a custom HTML Element could have many more applications.
