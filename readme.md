## Search And Save

I designed and built this as a means to save locations on my weather app. I plan to learn to build web components and this is ultimatley 
what I intend to do with it. As it is now, it works rather well but the application is cumbersome.  I feel like this could be a useful component
and as a custom HTML Element could have many more applications.

I plan to style the checkbox to make it  bit more modern. But for now its totally functional and as is takes a bit of code to use. The HTML and can be placed in a div and put anywhere it fits. I have a lot to consider to make this a real component. What attributes to expose, what can be styled, and it needs to be sizable. Should be a good one to learn with.
